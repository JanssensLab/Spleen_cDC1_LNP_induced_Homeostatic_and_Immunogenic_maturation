# Spleen_cDC1_LNP_induced_Homeostatic_and_Immunogenic_maturation

## About

Dendritic cells (DCs) are short-lived immune cells that continuously scan our body for the presence of foreign or self-antigens. As soon as they acquire antigen, they mature and start migrating to the lymph node to present the antigen to na√Øve T cells. Depending on how the antigen is perceived, as innocuous or as dangerous, they will mature in a homeostatic or immunogenic manner. So far, the field is lacking proper tools to distinguish between the two maturation states. Most maturation markers are shared and therefore inappropriate to use. Still, defining the proper maturation type is crucial as it determines how the DCs will instruct the T cells towards antigen expressing cells. In this study, we used a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based approach to steer DC maturation pathways in vivo. CITE-Seq analysis allowed us to design a panel of flow cytometry markers that can be used to reliably annotate the two maturation states. The data also revealed that the uptake of empty LNPs induces homeostatic DC maturation, indicating that LNPs have no intrinsic adjuvants activity.
